Please note:

We are performing a system stress test on Thursday, 2nd March between 1:00pm to 3:00pm. During which time we will be uploading periodic result files.

Unfortunately, due to a last minute polling place change, our stress test data does not match our production data setup files. 
While the polling place numbers are consistent the names have changed, see details below:

	1)	Murray-Wellington - Brunswick Junction Primary School (stress test) has been replaced by the Brunswick Town Hall (production).
	2)	Roe - Katanning Town Hall (stress test) has been replaced by Katanning Leisure and Function Centre (production).
	
We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.
